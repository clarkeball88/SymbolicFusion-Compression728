## üî∑ Overview

The Symbolic Compression System is a groundbreaking symbolic number theory and compression engine that eliminates decimals, zero, and negative numbers in favor of a mirrored, recursive symbolic language. It introduces a new numerical framework rooted in precision, recursion, and self-correction. The system is capable of:

- Ultra-high compression ratios via macro folding
- Symbolic arithmetic logic operations (ADD, SUB, NOT, AND, OR, XOR)
- Accurate expression of constants (œÄ, ‚àö2, œÜ) in fully symbolic form
- Tiered symbolic encoding for scalable, lossless data compression
- Fusion-theoretic potential via recursive compression systems

This repository represents the culmination of a new logic era ‚Äî where symbolic math replaces flawed approximations and unlocks exponential computational power.
